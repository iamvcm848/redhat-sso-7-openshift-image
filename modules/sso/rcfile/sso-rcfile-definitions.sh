# NOTE: This script intentionally doesn't include the Bash 'set -u' option
#       (the set builtin option to treat unset variables as errors) on the
#       previous line, since it's included in the RH-SSO container runtime
#       phase too, and there it could cause unsolicited container aborts when
#       checking if some optional runtime env var was specified or not


### RH-SSO globally used variables

# CIAM-1394 Use a non-printable character - ASCII 31 (octal 037) unit
# separator character as the sed substitute (s) command delimiter for each
# existing call of "sed -i" and "sed -e" across the various container image
# modules, where either the regexp or the replacement value is dynamically
# generated (IOW it's not a fixed string) and it's based on / derived from
# the value of some environment variable.
#
# Do this to avoid clash of the sed substitute command delimiter with some
# special character specified in env var value (e.g. in password), leading to:
#
# * sed: -e expression #1, char <CHAR_POS>: unterminated `s' command
# * sed: -e expression #1, char <CHAR_POS>: unknown option to 's'
#
# type of errors
# shellcheck disable=SC2034

# ampersand working also for sed on the right-hand side, we need to type a
# '\&'.
#
# Moreover, the backslash (\) character itself needs to be escaped for Bash
# with another backslash per relevant Bash guide section:
#
#  https://www.gnu.org/software/bash/manual/bash.html#ANSI_002dC-Quoting
#
# Thus to enter a literal ampersand working on the right-hand side of the
# sed substitute command, called from Bash script, we need to type '\\&'.

### Script body

# Important:
# ----------
#
# RHSSO-2017 Since we want to escape the special XML characters (replace them
# with their XML escape sequence counterparts) possibly present in the values
# of selected environment variables (those that don't have a special meaning to
# the shell itself) in both the current shell environment and also in the
# subsequent child shell sessions, the
# "sanitize_shell_env_vars_to_valid_xml_values()" function below is truly
# intended to be executed RIGHT AWAY in the moment this script definition is
# being Bash "source"d (included in another Bash script / module).
#
# Executing the function right away as part of the sourcing ensures also values
# of the environment variables in the current shell will be sanitized (and via
# export also propagated to subsequent child shells), see e.g.:
#
# * https://stackoverflow.com/a/28489593
# * https://www.man7.org/linux/man-pages/man1/bash.1.html#SHELL_BUILTIN_COMMANDS
#   (see the section dedicated to the 'source' directive)
#
# in contrary to the case when just the copy of the environment variable
# accessible to the subshell, from which the function was called would be
# updated
#
